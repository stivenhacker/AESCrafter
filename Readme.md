## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Key Generation:** Creates a 16-byte (128-bit) AES key using Python's cryptographically secure random generator `os.urandom`.
- **Hexadecimal Conversion:** Converts the raw binary key into a 32-character hexadecimal string for easy use in various applications.
- **Key Verification:** Automatically verifies that the generated key has the correct length of 32 characters to ensure cryptographic validity.
- **Quick and Simple:** Generates and outputs the key in a matter of seconds, with no complicated setup required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Running **AESCrafter** is straightforward and requires no special configuration:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stivenhacker/AESCrafter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   ```bash
   cd AESCrafter
   ```

3. **Run the script:**  
   ```bash
   python AESKeyGen32.py
   ```

4. **Receive your 32-character AES key!**

The output will display the key and its length, confirming that the key generation was successful:
```
32-character AES key: [Your AES Key]
Key length: 32
```
